* [SCP Linux Command â€“ How to SSH File Transfer from Remote to Local](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/scp-linux-command-example-how-to-ssh-file-transfer-from-remote-to-local/)<br>
This site explains the `scp` command syntax and its various use cases. The site also provide the readers
with easy-to-understand explanations and the command's example use case.

* [How to change directory permissions in Linux with chmod](https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/it-ops/linux-file-permissions)<br>
This one is about `chmod` and its usage. This site looks a lot like a FAQ page with short and to-the-point
explanations, and I think it's a good thing.

* [Differences Between Single and Double Brackets in Bash](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/bash-single-vs-double-brackets)<br>
I once saw a `cat` command in one of [os.vlsm.org](os.vlsm.org) tutorials. The command had a single angle bracket and
a group of triple brackets as its syntax. I had no idea what do the angle brackets mean and what are
the differences between the triple angle brackets and the single bracket, so I did a quick google
search. This site is what I found.

* [SCP](https://doit.vlsm.org/019.html)<br>
This one helped me so much, so I've decided to include this. I frequently look back at this site to
copy my files from my computer's native OS to Debian. This site is so helpful that I'm currently using
the `scp` syntax provided by this site to copy this file to Debian.
