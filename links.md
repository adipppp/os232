* [SCP Linux Command â€“ How to SSH File Transfer from Remote to Local](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/scp-linux-command-example-how-to-ssh-file-transfer-from-remote-to-local/)<br>
This site explains the `scp` command syntax and its various use cases. The site also provide the readers
with easy-to-understand explanations and the command's example use case.

* [How to change directory permissions in Linux with chmod](https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/it-ops/linux-file-permissions)<br>
This one is about `chmod` and its usage. This site looks a lot like a FAQ page with short and to-the-point
explanations, and I think it's a good thing.

* [Differences Between Single and Double Brackets in Bash](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/bash-single-vs-double-brackets)<br>
I once saw a `cat` command in one of [os.vlsm.org](os.vlsm.org) tutorials. The command had a single angle bracket and
a group of triple brackets as its syntax. I had no idea what do the angle brackets mean and what are
the differences between the triple angle brackets and the single bracket, so I did a quick google
search. This site is what I found.

* [SCP](https://doit.vlsm.org/019.html)<br>
This one helped me so much, so I've decided to include this. I frequently look back at this site to
copy my files from my computer's native OS to Debian. This site is so helpful that I'm currently using
the `scp` syntax provided by this site to copy this file to Debian.

* [Grep Command Tutorial - How to Search for a File in Linux and Unix with Recursive Find](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/grep-command-tutorial-how-to-search-for-a-file-in-linux-and-unix/)<br>
I found this site while I was working on Pop Quiz W02-2. This site helped me understand
the grep syntax and the usage of its commonly used options.

* [Regular Expressions](https://hbctraining.github.io/Training-modules/Advanced_shell/lessons/03_Regular_expressions.html)<br>
This one is about regular expressions. What I like about this site is that it also
explains how to use regex with grep commands. The usage examples also helped me
memorize the grep syntax and its usage with regular expressions.

* [Mounting and unmounting media using Linux](https://bladecenter.lenovofiles.com/help/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.lenovo.bladecenter.mgtmod.doc%2Fkp1bd_t_mounting_media_using_linux.html)
This website describes how to mount and unmount in Linux, straight to the point.

* [Makefile Tutorial By Example](https://makefiletutorial.com)
This site explains how to get started with Makefile as well as lots of other
Makefile features and syntax. This guide makes getting started with Makefile
feel easy for starters, yet provides off extra information for those searching
for more Makefile's features.

* [How to compress the whole directory using xz and tar in Linux](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/compress-the-whole-directory-using-xz-and-tar/)
I particularly liked this site because it has a neat `tar` and `xz` cheat sheet
and its use cases at the end of the web page.
